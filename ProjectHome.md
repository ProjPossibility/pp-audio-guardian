## Overview ##

AudioGuardian is a mobile Java application (J2ME) for use on Java-enabled mobile phones. The user's phone records surrounding noise and triggers alerts when it identifies interesting noises such as car horns, fire alarms, gunshots, and sirens. This application was created for people who are hearing impaired and might have difficulty knowing when they are in a dangerous situation. The project records emergency signals that people take for granted and makes them available to those who are hearing impaired.
